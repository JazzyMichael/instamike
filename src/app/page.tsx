        I’m seeking an onsite opportunity in Silicon Valley because I believe
        the highest levels of growth, both personally and professionally, happen
        in environments where the bar is set very high. I want to immerse myself
        in a culture filled with brilliant, hard-working individuals who are
        shaping the future of software—people who challenge and inspire each
        other, where excellence is not just encouraged but expected. Silicon
        Valley is where growth tracks for individual contributors are strongest,
        and where the quality of software, tools, and innovation is second to
        none.

        Meta is especially exciting to me because of the massive impact it
        has—connecting billions of people across the world. I care deeply about
        building software that brings people together and makes the world feel
        smaller, kinder, and more open. On top of that, I’ve always admired
        Meta’s contributions to open-source and dev tooling—React and React
        Native have been part of my daily toolkit for years. The product-minded
        engineering culture at Meta is another major draw: I believe that in
        2025, the coding aspect of our jobs should be the easy part. High-impact
        engineers operate closest to the product, shaping direction, analyzing
        tech and user feedback, and iterating rapidly to unlock scale and
        leverage. That mindset resonates deeply with me.
